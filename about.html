    I'm a software developer with a passion for creating web applications and exploring new technologies.
    <br>
    I have experience in various programming languages and frameworks, including JavaScript, Python, and React.
    <br>
    I enjoy solving complex problems and building user-friendly interfaces that enhance the overall user experience.
    <br>
    I believe in the power of collaboration and open-source development, and I actively contribute to projects that
    align with my interests.
    <br>
    In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects, contributing to open source, and learning new programming
    languages.
    <br>

    No, just kidding. GitHub Copilot wrote that whole thing on the opening &lt;p&gt; (I would never use React) :)</p>
